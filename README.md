# The End of The Semester
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, April 2022

## Theme
We interpreted the theme to be exactly how the end of each semester feels. Towards the end of each semester assignments build up and due dates come fast.

## Game Play
Your objective is to make it through all three levels while being hunted by an enemy. 
Use the keys A and S to move left and right. Use Space to jump.

## Impediments
Level three broke last minute.
## Implementation
